The previous AI engineer's work centered on stabilizing and expanding the Viral Daily application, a full-stack project displaying viral videos. Initial efforts were plagued by persistent deployment issues on Railway and Vercel, primarily due to inconsistent configurations (e.g.,  overriding ) and underlying MongoDB connectivity problems. The engineer iteratively resolved these by switching between various server entry points (, , , ), refining health checks, and implementing graceful degradation for database failures. Key accomplishments include fixing video count limits, ensuring correct TikTok/Twitter link and thumbnail displays (using base64 SVGs), and resolving pervasive Google AdSense 400 errors. The trajectory concludes with the engineer actively implementing monetization features, specifically integrating subscription usage limits and API access locks.

The Viral Daily application aims to aggregate and display the 10 most viral videos daily from YouTube, X (Twitter), and TikTok through a web interface, complemented by daily email updates. The monetization strategy is a SaaS model offering Free, Pro, and Business tiers, each providing varying video access limits and API availability, alongside advertising revenue. The application currently features a functional user interface, integrates YouTube and Twitter APIs (TikTok uses mock data), user authentication, and a tiered subscription system with live PayPal integration. Advertisement injection, basic analytics, and SendGrid for email digests are implemented. Telegram Bot and Twilio notifications are present but require API keys. Advanced monetization includes Google AdSense, affiliate marketing, premium content, and brand partnerships with fixed URLs. The primary objective of recent work was to achieve stable production deployments on Railway (backend) and Vercel (frontend), resolve video display issues (count, links, thumbnails), eliminate console errors, and initiate profitability efforts.

<code_architecture>
The application employs a standard full-stack architecture, with separate  and  directories.



-   : Manages Python dependencies.  was added for MongoDB integration.
-   : The primary FastAPI application. Heavily refactored to handle MongoDB connection gracefully, include a non-database dependent health check, integrate platform filtering, and house the full suite of features (auth, payments, analytics). It now includes a  block for Uvicorn execution.
-   : Crucial for Railway deployments, often updated to point to the correct startup script (, , , , ) and adjust healthcheck timeouts and retries.
-   : Defines the start command for Railway. Updated in sync with  to point to the desired server/startup script.
-   : A temporary, minimal FastAPI server for achieving initial successful Railway deployment, then enhanced to provide 40 videos with basic thumbnails and links. It was briefly used as a deployment target multiple times.
-   : The current main backend entry point. Created as a single comprehensive server combining reliability with a broad set of full server features like subscription tiers, platform filtering, and enhanced video content.
-   , , , : Various startup scripts created and iterated upon to address Railway deployment challenges, health check timeouts, and ensure the correct full-featured server (or a robust minimal/hybrid version) was launched. They handle environment variables and graceful service initialization.
-    & : Environment variables for the frontend. Crucially,  was fixed to point to the correct Railway backend URL, resolving the no videos issue.
-   : The main React component. Modified to fetch videos, integrate platform filtering, display upgrade banners, and incorporate API access locks based on user tier. It orchestrates the display of videos and interactions.
-   : This component manages Google AdSense ads. It was modified to entirely disable ad script loading and display professional placeholders when  to eliminate pervasive 400 console errors, allowing for future re-enablement.
-    & : These components handle PayPal payment integration. They were noted as already present and functioning for the monetization strategy.
-   : Defines the different subscription tiers (Free, Pro, Business) and their respective limits. Ensured the Free tier correctly allows for 40 videos.
-   : Used as a living document to track issues, fixes, and testing outcomes. Regularly updated by the AI engineer.
-   : A newly created document outlining the plan to generate revenue from the application.

<pending_tasks>
-   Implement real Instagram Graph API (not in current scope, but previously considered).
-   Improve email content to avoid spam.
-   Integrate Analytics (e.g., Google Analytics/Mixpanel) for deeper insights.
-   Implement Automated Social Sharing.
-   Transition  endpoint from mock data to live API calls for all platforms (YouTube, TikTok, Twitter) while handling API rate limits and quotas.
-   Set up Twilio environment variables in Railway for full Twilio functionality.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on implementing the first set of monetization features to make the Viral Daily application profitable. This directly followed the successful resolution of frontend display issues, including fixing the no videos problem by correcting the backend URL in the frontend's environment files (, ) and ensuring a reliable backend server was deployed (pivoting to ). The previous critical console errors related to Google AdSense (400 errors) were also eliminated by completely disabling AdSense script loading in  and displaying clean ad placeholders.

The current work revolves around leveraging the existing PayPal integration and subscription tier system to drive revenue. The AI engineer initiated changes in  to:
1.  **Introduce Usage Limits**: Display prompts related to usage limits for free tier users.
2.  **Implement Premium Feature Locks**: Specifically, adding a lock for API access, ensuring that only users with higher subscription tiers can access it. This involves checking the  and conditionally rendering elements or showing upgrade calls-to-action.

The engineer found that the  state was undefined and correctly identified  as the appropriate state to control the visibility of subscription plan information. Changes were applied to  to implement these UI-driven monetization nudges.

The last action recorded was the successful modification of  to add premium feature locks and the AI engineer's intention to commit these changes and then create API documentation to support the API business.
