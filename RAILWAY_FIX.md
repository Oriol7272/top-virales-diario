# Railway Deployment Fix

## Issue Fixed:
- Pydantic model compatibility error in models.py
- Fixed User model with proper ConfigDict for Pydantic v2
- Pinned pydantic version to 2.6.4 for stability
- Added proper email-validator dependency

## Changes Made:
1. Updated models.py imports to include ConfigDict
2. Added model_config = ConfigDict(arbitrary_types_allowed=True) to User class
3. Fixed requirements.txt with specific pydantic version

## Status:
Ready for Railway deployment with all environment variables set.
