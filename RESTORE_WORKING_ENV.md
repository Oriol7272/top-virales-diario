# üîß Restore Working Environment

## After Cloning from GitHub

Your GitHub repository has placeholder API keys for security. To restore the working environment:

### 1. Restore Backend Environment
```bash
cd backend
cp .env.backup .env
# Your working API keys are now restored
```

### 2. Verify Services
```bash
# Check backend
sudo supervisorctl restart backend
curl http://localhost:8001/api/videos

# Check frontend  
sudo supervisorctl restart frontend
# Visit http://localhost:3000
```

### 3. Your Working API Keys Are:
- ‚úÖ **SendGrid**: Working and verified
- ‚úÖ **PayPal**: Live EUR credentials functional
- ‚úÖ **YouTube**: API integration working
- ‚úÖ **Twitter**: Bearer token active

### 4. For New Deployments
Use the `.env.example` files and fill in your actual API keys.
